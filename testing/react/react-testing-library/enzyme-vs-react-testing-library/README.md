## Enzyme vs react-testing-library

Tutorial: https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/integration-testing-in-react-21f92a55a894

As of this writing, the only major libraries I can find which fit this bill are Airbnbâ€™s Enzyme JS and 
react-testing-library. Enzyme is already an incredibly popular library for unit testing React applications whereas 
react-testing-library is an alternative developed by Kent C. Dodds which is specifically meant for integration testing.
